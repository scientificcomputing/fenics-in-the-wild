# Overview of project

This project brings together the [FEniCS Project](https://fenicsproject.org) finite element software, and the [wildmeshing-toolkit](https://wildmeshing.github.io/).
The overall project ambition is a user-efficient pipeline for imaging-based multi-physics simulations across scales, with advanced techniques such as uncertainty quantification, data assimilation, and physics-based machine learning as inherently added value.

The technology development and integration will be driven by use cases from biomedical research through well-established collaborations, including in clinical neurology (brain clearance, drug delivery, and neurovascular coupling), cellular mechanobiology (long-term potentiation), orthopedic surgery (hip joint motion), and molecular biology (autophagy in cancer).
To achieve its overarching ambition, the project aims:

- To make the integrated use of FEniCSx and wildmeshing accessible to a broad user base, through continuous-integration, unified documentation, and end-to-end tutorials.
- To create a plugin for the popular biomedical software 3D Slicer to support the automatic creation of digital twins of biomedical systems
- To extend wildmeshing to multi-material meshing and insertion of co-dimensional objects (tendons, cartilages) essential for many target applications
- To improve support for biomedical simulations in FEniCSx including multi-scale features such as vasculature-tissue or membrane-cell interaction models
  - The core library used for this work-package can be found at [FEniCSx_ii](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/fenicsx_ii)
